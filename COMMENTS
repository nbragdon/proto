There are no external dependencies so running it should be pretty straight forward.
In Python3 run `python parse_custom_protocol_format.py`

This should output: an array of records reformatted, the length of the array, and a json blob with the answers to the questions.

What is balance of user ID 2456938384156277127? 0.0

Side Notes:
The analysis could have been done while reading through the file, results in an O(n) time.
I decided to first create the translated records and then analyze them because I feel in production code that is most likely
how the processing would work, resulting in an O(2n) time which technically reduces to O(n) but does add some overhead
that could be avoided.

The code solves the problem at hand but with some tweaking could be made more generic. You could essentially 
create a config file processor. The config file would define what the headers are and the size of them, along with the record fields 
and their sizes. You could use the same conversion function for different types of files, as long as you create the new 
config for them.
